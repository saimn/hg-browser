# Mercurial Browser

This is currently just a small experiment to play with React (and Backbone
before) and a REST server with bottle, to visualize commits from a Mercurial
repository.

The Mercurial repositories must be listed in a `app.ini` file:

    [repos]
    hg-prompt = ~/lib/hg-prompt
    mercurial-cli-templates = ~/lib/mercurial-cli-templates
